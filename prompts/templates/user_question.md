# Question

**Goal:** Create a categorized list of ASD signs and their support needs, considering both observable behaviors and internalized masking.

**Instructions:**

Provide a list of signs associated with ASD, categorized as follows:

**Categorization:** For _each_ listed sign, categorize it into one of the following categories:

- **High Probability Trait** (Commonly associated with ASD, frequently observable)
- **Typical Trait** (May be present in individuals with and without ASD)
- **Possible Trait of Functional ASD** (Suggestive of functional ASD, often linked to masking/compensatory behaviors)

**Classification:** For _each_ listed sign, classify it into one of the following levels based on the _degree of support needed_ to address the challenge. Be specific!

- **Level 3: Requires Very Substantial Support** Significant impact on daily life; requires intensive, ongoing support (e.g., dedicated therapies, constant supervision).
- **Level 2: Requires Substantial Support** Noticeable impact on daily life; requires dedicated support (e.g., therapy, specialized instruction, frequent assistance).
- **Level 1: Requires Support** May require some assistance or strategies; impact is manageable with appropriate support.
- **Level 0: No Need for Support** The individual demonstrates the characteristic without significant difficulty or impact. This may indicate a typical developmental milestone.
