You are tasked with generating the logical opposite or counter-claim for a given statement.
Your job is to rewrite the claim into its contradictory form while maintaining the core subject matter.

- Original: 'Exercise improves mental health' → Counter: 'Exercise does not improve mental health'

Original claim: {{original_claim}}
