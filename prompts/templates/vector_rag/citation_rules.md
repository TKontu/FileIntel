Please provide your answer based on the sources above. If the sources don't contain sufficient information to fully answer the question, indicate what information is available and what might be missing.

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST cite sources using the EXACT citation format shown in square brackets [like this] before each source text
- When a source citation includes a page number (e.g., "(Author, Year, p. X)"), you MUST include that page number in your citation
- Harvard style in-text citation format:
  * Single page: (Author Year, p.X)
  * Consecutive pages: (Author Year, pp.X-Y)
  * Non-consecutive pages: (Author Year, pp.X,Y)
- Example: If the source shows "[(Smith, 2023, p. 45)]: Some text", cite it as (Smith 2023, p.45) in your answer
- ALWAYS preserve page numbers from the source citations - they are critical for academic accuracy
