# Answer Format: Essay

Please provide your answer in the format of a clean, flowing essay with a single headline.

Your response **must** be a JSON object containing two keys:
1.  `"title"`: A string for the main title/headline of the essay.
2.  `"content"`: A string containing the full essay text as multiple flowing paragraphs.

The content should be written as a coherent essay with smooth transitions between ideas. Do not include section headings within the content - write it as continuous prose divided into paragraphs.

### Example of Expected Format

```json
{
  "title": "The Evolution of Agile Development Beyond Software",
  "content": "Agile development, initially conceived for software development in 2001, has evolved far beyond its original scope. The methodology, characterized by iterative development, cross-functional collaboration, and adaptive planning, has proven valuable across diverse industries.\n\nIn recent years, sectors such as manufacturing, education, and healthcare have increasingly adopted agile principles. This expansion demonstrates the versatility of agile approaches in managing complex projects and responding to change. Organizations in these industries have adapted the core tenets of agility to fit their unique operational contexts.\n\nThe success of agile in non-software environments can be attributed to its fundamental emphasis on flexibility and continuous improvement. These principles resonate across industries facing rapid change and uncertainty. As organizations continue to navigate increasingly complex challenges, the adoption of agile methodologies is likely to expand further into new domains."
