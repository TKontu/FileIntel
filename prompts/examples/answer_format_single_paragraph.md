# Answer Format: Single Paragraph

Please provide your answer as a **single, cohesive paragraph** under one clear headline.

Your response **must** be a JSON object with two keys:
1. `"headline"`: A string containing a clear, concise headline that captures the main point of the answer (5-10 words).
2. `"paragraph"`: A string containing the complete answer as a single, flowing paragraph. Do not use bullet points, lists, or multiple paragraphs.

### Example of Expected Format

```json
{
  "headline": "Project Status and Key Milestones",
  "paragraph": "The project is currently ahead of schedule with a budget surplus of $15,000, primarily due to efficient resource allocation in the development phase. The team successfully completed Phase 1 two weeks early, allowing for earlier initiation of Phase 2 activities. Marketing efforts have exceeded initial targets by 23%, contributing to increased stakeholder confidence. The recommended next steps include re-allocating the surplus funds to marketing initiatives and proceeding immediately with the next development phase to maintain momentum."
}
```
