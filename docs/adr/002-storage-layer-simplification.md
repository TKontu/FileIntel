# ADR-002: Storage Layer Simplification

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The FileIntel storage layer had accumulated several architectural issues:

1. **Over-Abstraction**: A single monolithic `StorageInterface` that mixed document operations with GraphRAG-specific operations
2. **Unnecessary Wrappers**: Multiple service layers that simply delegated to storage methods without adding value
3. **Complex Caching**: Over-engineered cache management system with multiple cache types and strategies
4. **Theoretical Flexibility**: Abstractions designed for multiple implementations when only PostgreSQL was used
5. **Code Bloat**: Dead imports, unused functions, and wrapper layers that obscured actual functionality

The previous architecture included:
- Monolithic `StorageInterface` with 30+ methods
- Multiple storage service wrappers in `api/dependencies.py`
- Complex `cache_manager.py` with hierarchical cache abstractions
- Unused Redis storage implementation
- Abstract base classes with single implementations

## Decision

We decided to simplify the storage layer by eliminating unnecessary abstractions and focusing on actual usage patterns.

### Key Changes:

1. **Split Storage Interfaces**:
   - `DocumentStorageInterface`: Core document and collection operations
   - `GraphRAGStorageInterface`: GraphRAG-specific operations (entities, communities)
   - Applied Interface Segregation Principle

2. **Remove Unnecessary Abstractions**:
   - Eliminated storage service wrappers that provided no value
   - Removed over-engineered cache management system
   - Deleted unused Redis storage implementation

3. **Simplify Caching**:
   - Replaced `cache_manager.py` with `simple_cache.py`
   - Direct Redis operations with focused functionality
   - Clear TTL management for different data types

4. **Direct Usage Pattern**:
   - Use concrete `PostgreSQLStorage` type in dependency injection
   - Eliminate wrapper functions around wrappers
   - Direct access to storage methods where appropriate

### Implementation Details:
- Kept focused interfaces for clear separation of concerns
- Single PostgreSQL implementation for both interfaces
- Simple Redis cache for LLM responses and embeddings
- Direct storage usage in API endpoints and services

## Consequences

### Positive:
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated 6 unused wrapper functions and complex cache hierarchies
2. **Clearer Dependencies**: Components only depend on methods they actually use
3. **Better Maintainability**: Simpler code is easier to understand and debug
4. **Performance**: Eliminated abstraction overhead and unnecessary layers
5. **SOLID Compliance**: Better adherence to Interface Segregation Principle
6. **Code Clarity**: Actual data flow is more transparent

### Negative:
1. **Less "Flexible"**: Theoretical ability to swap storage implementations removed
2. **Interface Coupling**: Components now depend on specific interfaces rather than single abstraction

### Neutral:
1. **PostgreSQL Focus**: Architecture optimized for actual usage (PostgreSQL only)
2. **Cache Simplification**: Less configuration options but covers actual use cases
3. **Interface Count**: Two focused interfaces instead of one monolithic interface

## Technical Details

### Before:
```python
# Monolithic interface with mixed concerns
class StorageInterface:
    # Document operations
    def create_collection(self, name: str) -> Collection: pass
    def get_document(self, doc_id: str) -> Document: pass

    # GraphRAG operations
    def save_graphrag_entities(self, entities: List[dict]) -> None: pass
    def get_graphrag_communities(self, collection_id: str) -> List[dict]: pass

    # 30+ methods mixing different concerns

# Wrapper functions that add no value
def get_collection_service(storage: StorageInterface = Depends(get_storage)):
    return CollectionService(storage)  # Just delegates
```

### After:
```python
# Focused interfaces with clear separation
class DocumentStorageInterface(ABC):
    def create_collection(self, name: str) -> Collection: pass
    def get_document(self, doc_id: str) -> Document: pass

class GraphRAGStorageInterface(ABC):
    def save_graphrag_entities(self, entities: List[dict]) -> None: pass
    def get_graphrag_communities(self, collection_id: str) -> List[dict]: pass

# Direct usage without unnecessary wrappers
def create_collection(name: str, storage: PostgreSQLStorage = Depends(get_storage)):
    return storage.create_collection(name)
```

## Measurements

### Code Reduction:
- **dependencies.py**: Reduced from 152 to 49 lines (68% reduction)
- **Removed Files**: `cache_manager.py` (complex caching), `redis_storage.py` (unused)
- **Wrapper Functions**: Eliminated 6 unused wrapper functions

### Interface Clarity:
- **DocumentStorageInterface**: 12 focused methods for core operations
- **GraphRAGStorageInterface**: 8 methods for GraphRAG-specific operations
- **Previously**: 30+ methods in monolithic interface

## Guidelines for Future Development

### Do's:
1. **Question Every Abstraction**: Ensure abstractions provide real value, not theoretical flexibility
2. **Use Concrete Types**: In dependency injection when only one implementation exists
3. **Separate Concerns**: Keep interfaces focused on specific responsibilities
4. **Eliminate Wrappers**: Unless they add significant value beyond delegation

### Don'ts:
1. **Don't Create Service Layers**: Unless they provide business logic beyond storage delegation
2. **Don't Abstract Preemptively**: Wait for actual need for multiple implementations
3. **Don't Add Configuration**: Unless it addresses real, current requirements

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Monolithic Interface**: Maintain single interface for simplicity
   - Rejected: Violates Interface Segregation Principle and mixes concerns

2. **Create More Granular Interfaces**: Separate every operation type
   - Rejected: Would create too many small interfaces without clear benefit

3. **Maintain Service Wrappers**: Keep service layers for potential future logic
   - Rejected: YAGNI principle - no current need for additional logic
